The game was published by Fuji Television, who would go on to publish Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, which was localized as Super Mario Bros. 2. Essentially, this game is a replica of the original, except with the sprites of the Toads and various enemies replaced with the likenesses of Japanese celebrities for a humorous effect, occasionally different levels, and the option to play as Luigi with his physics from Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, although the 2-player mode is removed as a result.',
